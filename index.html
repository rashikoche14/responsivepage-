            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education in India is primarily provided by public schools (controlled
                and funded by the government at three levels: central, state and local) and private schools. Under
                various articles of the Indian Constitution, free and compulsory education is provided as a fundamental
                right to children aged 6 to 14. The approximate ratio of public schools to private schools in India is
                7:5. Major policy initiatives in Indian education are numerous. Up until 1976, education policies and
                implementation were determined legally by each of India’s constitutional states. The 42nd amendment to
                the constitution in 1976 made education a ‘concurrent subject’. </p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">In ancient times, India had the Gurukula system of education in
                which anyone who wished to study went to a teacher's (Guru) house and requested to be taught. If
                accepted as a student by the guru, he would then stay at the guru's place and help in all activities
                at home. This not only created a strong tie between the teacher and the student, but also taught the
                student everything about running a house. The guru taught everything the child wanted to learn, from
                Sanskrit to the holy scriptures and from Mathematics to Metaphysics. The student stayed as long as
                she wished or until the guru felt that he had taught everything he could teach. All learning was
                closely linked to nature and to life, and not confined to memorizing some information.

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the
                acquisition of knowledge, skills, values, morals, beliefs, and habits. Educational methods
                include teaching, training, storytelling, discussion and directed research. Education frequently
                takes place under the guidance of educators, however learners can also educate themselves.
                Education can take place in formal or informal settings and any experience that has a formative
                effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be considered educational. The methodology of
                teaching is called pedagogy.

                Formal education is commonly divided formally into such stages as preschool or kindergarten,
                primary school, secondary school and then college, university, or apprenticeship.
